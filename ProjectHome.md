GNRation is a "web 2.0" PHP framework developed by the guys at gnration.com. The framework follows the MVC architecture and offers a wide variety of library extensions such as Facebook, Twitter abd Memcached support.

The framework is 100% open-source and we'd love it if you could get involved and help us develop it.
